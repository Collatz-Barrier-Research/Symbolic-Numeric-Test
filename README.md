Collatz Carry Automaton Simulation
üìù Overview
This script implements core components of a Barrier Framework for the Collatz conjecture, specifically simulating the transition function (S‚ÜíS‚Ä≤) of the carry automaton (based on DP Algorithm 1 in the associated theory paper).

The primary goal of the framework is to partition all odd integers n into finite classes called Barriers and show that the Collatz map causes these barriers to reduce toward verified values, proving convergence via strong induction.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Numeric vs. Symbolic Implementation
The current compute_successors function is a numerical implementation that tests a single number N per state. It does not yet implement the full symbolic transition function T(S) required by the theory (which proves the bounded set of successors for an indeterminate middle block M).

Feature	Implemented Logic	Theoretical Requirement
State Input	(m,d,P,r) where d is a fixed value.	(m,d,P,r) where d is the length of the indeterminate block M.
Transition	S‚ÜíS‚Ä≤(One-to-one mapping for a single number N).	B‚ÜíSet¬†of¬†B‚Ä≤(One barrier to a finite set of successor barriers).

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
The networkx and matplotlib libraries (for DAG analysis and optional visualization).
Bash
pip install networkx matplotlib

Usage
Run the script directly from your terminal:
Bash
python collatz_automaton.py

The script will automatically execute two main phases:
Residue DAG Analysis: Builds the v=1 transition graph for odd residues (mod 10^k) and computes the Longest Ascent Path (A_k).
DP Successors Test: Runs 12 assertion checks against known-correct outputs for the compute_successors logic.
Residue Merge Simulation: Runs a large-scale test using sample parameters to find the total number of unique successor states, simulating the merging required for the T-tree construction.
